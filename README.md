This application is an artefact prototype system for my Thesis.
It allows to collect knowledge representation from assigned users in a project via intelligent questions generated from sets of pre-defined Bayesian Networks.

To start the application,
1. Configure the database to be used, this artefact has been equipped with many database drivers. I would personally recommend sqlite as a starter point.
2. Configure the email entries (username and password) to notify assigned users
3. Create the networks, please see the sample variable.txt to see how the Bayesian Network is generated
